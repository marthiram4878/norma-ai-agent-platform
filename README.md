# What is Norma AI?

Modern people and companies are drowning in information.

Knowledge is spread across:

- Documents
- Emails
- Slack messages
- Notion pages
- Google Drive
- GitHub repositories
- Meeting notes
- PDFs
- Internal systems

The problem is not lack of information.

The problem is:

> Information exists, but intelligence cannot access it.

---

**Norma AI creates an intelligent layer between humans and their knowledge.**

It combines:

- Large Language Models
- Autonomous AI Agents
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Long-term Memory
- Workflow Automation

to create an AI operating system that understands, remembers and executes.

---

# Vision

Our vision is to build an AI system that works like a:

- Chief of Staff
- Research Analyst
- Product Manager
- Knowledge Manager
- Business Assistant
- Technical Advisor

Instead of asking:

> "What can AI answer?"

Norma asks:

> "What can AI help you accomplish?"

# Core Features

## Multi-Agent AI System

Norma is not a single chatbot.

It is an ecosystem of specialized AI agents working together.

# Intelligent Memory

Norma remembers context.

Examples:

```
User:
"I want to build a coffee business in Australia."

Norma stores:

- Business interests
- Previous decisions
- Market preferences
- Current projects
- Important context

Future conversations become smarter.
```

Norma AI begins as a modular monolith: domain boundaries remain explicit while
deployment stays simple for the MVP. PostgreSQL owns durable relational data,
Redis supports ephemeral coordination, and Qdrant owns vector search. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for dependency rules and the
scaling path.
