# What is Norma AI?

Knowledge is scattered across documents, chats, drives, and repos. Norma AI is
an intelligent layer between people and that knowledge: **RAG + multi-agent
workflows + long-term memory**, scoped by workspace, project, and knowledge space.

It combines:

- Large language models (via OpenRouter)
- LangGraph agent workflows
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (Qdrant + BGE-M3)
- Conversation and vectorized workspace memory
- Async workers for long-running ingest and strategy runs

---

# Vision

Build an AI system that works like a chief of staff, researcher, product manager,
and technical advisor — not only answering questions, but helping you **ship
outcomes**.

> Humans define goals. AI accelerates execution.

---

# Features (shipped)

- **RAG knowledge base** — PDF / DOCX / Markdown / TXT, async index, space isolation  
- **RAG Assistant** — cited answers, conversation threads, memory notes  
- **Launch Strategy pack** — research → planning → specs → content → ingest  
- **Live web research** — DuckDuckGo snippets for the Research Agent  
- **Auth** — email/password, HttpOnly JWT cookies, workspace membership  
- **Projects & knowledge spaces** — UI switcher + create flows  
- **Async workers** — Redis queue for documents and Launch Strategy, heartbeat readiness  
- **React workspace** — Assistant / Workflows / Knowledge views

# Multi-agent system

Launch Strategy coordinator (worker):

```text
retrieve → research → planning → spec → content → persist → memory
```

RAG Assistant (request path): retrieve → generate (or no-context).

Details: [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md).

# Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alex7develop/norma-ai-agent-platform.git
cd norma-ai-agent-platform
cp .env.example .env
# set SECRET_KEY and OPENROUTER_API_KEY
docker compose up --build
```

| http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ready | Readiness (incl. worker) |
| http://localhost:5173 | React UI (`cd frontend && npm run dev`) |

First embeddings boot may take several minutes (BGE-M3 download).

# Roadmap (summary)

Phases 1–4 are complete for the MVP product surface. **Phase 5** targets
enterprise connectors (Slack, Notion, GitHub, Google Drive, CRM).

Full checklist: [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

---

# Security

Workspace membership isolation, HttpOnly cookies, hashed refresh tokens, and
environment-backed secrets. Report vulnerabilities per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

---

# Philosophy

AI should amplify creativity, decisions, and execution — not replace judgment.

---

# Support

- Star the repository  
- Open issues with repro steps  
- Share product feedback
