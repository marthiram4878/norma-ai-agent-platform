# What is Norma AI?

Modern people and companies are drowning in information.

Knowledge is spread across:

- Documents
- Emails
- Slack messages
- Notion pages
- Google Drive
- GitHub repositories
- Meeting notes
- PDFs
- Internal systems

The problem is not lack of information.

The problem is:

> Information exists, but intelligence cannot access it.

---

**Norma AI creates an intelligent layer between humans and their knowledge.**

It combines:

- Large Language Models
- Autonomous AI Agents
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Long-term Memory
- Workflow Automation

to create an AI operating system that understands, remembers and executes.

---

# Vision

Our vision is to build an AI system that works like a:

- Chief of Staff
- Research Analyst
- Product Manager
- Knowledge Manager
- Business Assistant
- Technical Advisor

Instead of asking:

> "What can AI answer?"

Norma asks:

> "What can AI help you accomplish?"

# Core Features

## Multi-Agent AI System

Norma is not a single chatbot.

It is an ecosystem of specialized AI agents working together.

# Intelligent Memory

Norma remembers context.

Examples:

```
User:
"I want to build a coffee business in Australia."

Norma stores:

- Business interests
- Previous decisions
- Market preferences
- Current projects
- Important context

Future conversations become smarter.
```

Norma AI begins as a modular monolith: domain boundaries remain explicit while
deployment stays simple for the MVP. PostgreSQL owns durable relational data,
Redis supports ephemeral coordination, and Qdrant owns vector search. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for dependency rules and the
scaling path.

# Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/norma-ai.git
cd norma-ai
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

The API is available at `http://localhost:8000`, interactive documentation at
`http://localhost:8000/docs`, liveness at
`http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`, and infrastructure readiness at
`http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ready`.

Knowledge endpoints are available under `/api/v1/knowledge`. Uploads support
PDF, DOCX, Markdown, and TXT; semantic search is isolated by `workspace_id`.
The first Docker startup downloads BGE-M3 into a persistent model cache and can
therefore take several minutes.

The first agent endpoint is `POST /api/v1/assistant/query`. It runs a stateless
LangGraph workflow, retrieves only the requested workspace, and returns an
OpenRouter-generated answer together with explicit source metadata.

The first multi-agent workflow is `POST /api/v1/workflows/launch-strategy`.
A LangGraph coordinator runs Research, Planning, Spec, and Content agents, then
an Execution agent assembles a full Launch Strategy Pack (market, competitors,
positioning, roadmap, marketing, business model, financial outline, PRD, tech
spec, Cursor prompts, LinkedIn/Telegram) and ingests it into the workspace
knowledge base. A short workflow summary is also stored as workspace memory.
Load a prior run with `GET /api/v1/workflows/runs/{run_id}`.

The RAG assistant keeps conversation history via the Memory Agent
(`conversation_id` on `POST /api/v1/assistant/query`) and can list threads with
`GET /api/v1/assistant/conversations`.

The React workspace at `http://localhost:5173` provides registration, login,
document upload, document management, Launch Strategy runs, remembered chat,
assistant answers with citations. Sessions use HttpOnly cookies; knowledge,
assistant, and workflow APIs require membership in the requested workspace.

For backend development without Docker:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env
uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend --reload
pytest
```

For frontend development:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Security

Norma AI is designed with privacy in mind.

Principles:

- User data isolation
- Secure API communication
- Controlled tool execution
- Permission-based integrations


---

# Philosophy


AI should not replace human thinking.

AI should amplify:

- Creativity
- Decision making
- Execution speed
- Knowledge management


Norma AI is built around this idea:

> Humans define goals. AI accelerates execution.


---

# Future Vision

The future workplace will not be humans versus AI.

It will be humans working with intelligent systems.

Norma AI aims to become the operating layer between people and information — helping individuals and organizations transform knowledge into action.
